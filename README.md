# To-Do-List-Source-Code-
This Python script creates a simple To-Do List application using the Tkinter library. The application interface consists of five tasks, each with a corresponding checkbox and text entry field. The tasks can be marked as complete using the checkboxes and saved using a "Save" button. The script captures the text from the entry fields and prints it in the console when the "Save" button is pressed.

Key Components
Checkbuttons: Allow users to mark tasks as complete.
Entry Widgets: Provide input fields for users to type their tasks.
Button: Triggers the get_text function to save and print the entered tasks.

Layout
The layout is managed using the grid method, with each task and its checkbox arranged in a row.
The window has a title "To Do List" and is set to a size of 500x500 pixels.
